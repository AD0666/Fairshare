# Final Fix - Last Step!

## What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

In the backend PowerShell terminal:

1. **Press Ctrl+C** to stop the current process

2. **Close the terminal completely**

3. **Open a NEW PowerShell window**

4. **Navigate and start fresh:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\npmd1\Startup\Splitwise\backend
npm run dev
```

This fresh start should fix the ts-node cache issue!

```
✅ Database connected successfully
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000

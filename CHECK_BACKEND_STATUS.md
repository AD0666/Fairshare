# Check Backend Server Status

## Look at Your Backend Terminal

You should see one of these:

**✅ Success:**
```
✅ Database connected successfully
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

**❌ Error:**
Some error message will appear

---

## What Should You See?

In the PowerShell window where you ran `npm run dev` in the backend folder, check the output.

**Please tell me what you see in that terminal!**

---

## Common Issues

**If you see "Database connection error":**
- Check PostgreSQL service is running
- Verify .env file has correct password

**If you see compilation errors:**
- I'll need to see the full error message

**If you see nothing:**
- The server might have crashed
- Scroll up to see the error

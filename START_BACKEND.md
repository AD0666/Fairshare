# Start Backend Server

## What You Need to Do

**Open a NEW PowerShell window** (separate from the one you're using now).

In that NEW window, run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\npmd1\Startup\Splitwise\backend
npm run dev
```

**This will:**
1. Start the backend server
2. Show you any errors that occur
3. Display: "🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000"

## What You Should See

**Success:**
```
✅ Database connected successfully
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

**Error:**
- Any error messages will appear here
- Share the error with me!

---

## Keep This Terminal Open!

Leave this PowerShell window running - this is your backend server.

---

**Run that command and tell me what you see!** 🚀
